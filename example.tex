	A third person, \phrase[A]{person} acts as a prisoner. \textbf{1} is speaking to \phrase[A]{}.
	
	\begin{line}[1]
		Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything for \phrase[A]{}! Put me in his/her place. You can do anything to me, I don't care, just get him/her to \phrase{place}!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		The prisoner and the \phrase{object} will \phrase{verb} together. Observe. The last child of \phrase{noun representing something large or important} is powerless.
	\end{line}
	
	\begin{line}[1]
		Don't move, \phrase[A]{}. Stay still. 
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		Guard them! On your knees! Surrender!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[1]
		You can't, \phrase[C]{}. Just listen to me! Just stop!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		\emph{(evil laugh)} Ah, ha ha ha! Nothing can stop the \phrase[D as noun]{}. Nothing and no one!
	\end{line}

	EXPLOSIONS happen!
	
	\begin{line}[1]
		But that's...
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		Impossible!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[1]
		We've stopped the \phrase[D]{}!
		\phrase[A]{}, you are \phrase{adjective}!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		Noooooo! Once again, you've foiled my plans. And I would have \phrase{verb, past participle} if it wasn't for you damn \phrase{gerund} kids!
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[1]
		Oh no! The \phrase[D]{} is continuing! We must \phrase{verb} the \phrase{device} into a \phrase{sci-fi adjective} \phrase{sci-fi noun}! Hurry up! \phrase[C]{}, you have betrayed us.
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[2]
		It's not me. It was \phrase{person we don't like}. How do you feel, \phrase[B]{}. \phrase{feeling}, \phrase{weird feeling}, \phrase{weird feeling}?
	\end{line}

	\begin{line}[1]
		You have won, but at what cost? How could I not \phrase{verb} the \phrase[D]{} myself? Why, why, why????
	\end{line}
